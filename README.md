# nixos
Configs for my Nixos build

This is my main config for nixos and some dotfiles. 

It uses Awesome Window Manager, the Ranger file manager and Kitty for a terminal. Dotfiles for those three are included.

The Awesome Window Manager uses widgets from here: https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets
